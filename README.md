## Data Mining Crop
---
In this teamwork project, we used a dataset associated with crops. 

First, we analyzed the distributions, outliers, data types and values of the dataset attributes. 

Then PCA, Isomap and t-SNE models were used for dimensionality reduction, comparing the different results that were obtained.


Finally, we apply clustering models, including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, determining the optimal number of clusters with techniques such as GAP or Silhouette.
